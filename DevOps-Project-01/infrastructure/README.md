# AWS Infrastructure for Java Application

This directory contains Terraform configurations to set up the AWS infrastructure for the Java application deployment. The infrastructure follows AWS best practices and implements a secure, scalable, and highly available architecture.

## Architecture Overview

The infrastructure consists of:

- VPC with public and private subnets across multiple availability zones
- Application Load Balancer (ALB) in public subnets
- EC2 instances in private subnets managed by Auto Scaling Groups
- RDS MySQL database in private subnets
- Bastion host for secure SSH access
- CloudWatch monitoring and logging

## Prerequisites

1. **AWS Account and Credentials**
   - AWS account with appropriate permissions
   - AWS CLI installed and configured
   - Access key and secret key with necessary permissions

2. **Tools**
   - Terraform >= 1.0.0
   - AWS CLI >= 2.0.0

```

## Usage

1. **Initialize Terraform**
   ```bash
   terraform init
   ```

2. **Configure Variables**
   Create a `terraform.tfvars` file:
   ```hcl
   environment        = "dev"
   aws_region        = "us-east-1"
   vpc_cidr          = "192.168.0.0/16"
   public_subnets    = ["192.168.1.0/24", "192.168.2.0/24"]
   private_subnets   = ["192.168.3.0/24", "192.168.4.0/24"]
   db_username       = "admin"
   db_password       = "your-secure-password"
   key_name          = "your-key-pair-name"
   ```

3. **Plan the Infrastructure**
   ```bash
   terraform plan -out=tfplan
   ```

4. **Apply the Infrastructure**
   ```bash
   terraform apply tfplan
   ```

## Security Considerations

1. **Network Security**
   - All application servers are in private subnets
   - Only the ALB is exposed to the internet
   - Bastion host for secure SSH access

2. **Database Security**
   - RDS instance in private subnet
   - Access restricted to application servers
   - Automated backups enabled

3. **Access Management**
   - IAM roles for EC2 instances
   - Security groups with minimal required access
   - VPC flow logs enabled

## Monitoring and Logging

1. **CloudWatch Metrics**
   - CPU utilization
   - Memory usage
   - Network traffic
   - Database connections

2. **CloudWatch Logs**
   - Application logs
   - VPC flow logs
   - Load balancer access logs

## Cost Optimization

1. **Resource Sizing**
   - Right-sized instances based on workload
   - Auto Scaling for optimal resource utilization

2. **Storage Management**
   - Automated cleanup of old logs
   - Lifecycle policies for backups

## Maintenance

1. **Backup Strategy**
   - Automated RDS backups
   - Retention period configurable
   - Point-in-time recovery enabled

2. **Updates and Patches**
   - Use AWS Systems Manager for updates
   - Automated security patches
   - Rolling updates for zero downtime

## Troubleshooting

1. **Common Issues**
   - Check security group rules
   - Verify subnet configurations
   - Review CloudWatch logs

2. **Support**
   - Create GitHub issues for bugs
   - Contact maintainers for critical issues
