![Two-Tier Architecture](https://imgur.com/X4dGBg6.gif)

## 📌 Overview  

This project demonstrates a **Two-Tier architecture on AWS** using **Terraform** for Infrastructure as Code (IaC). It follows a modular and security-enhanced approach to create a **scalable, secure, and maintainable** infrastructure.  

### ✅ Key Features  

- **Modular Architecture** – Reusable Terraform modules for better management  
- **Infrastructure as Code (IaC)** – Automate AWS resource provisioning  
- **Security Best Practices** – IAM roles, policies, and WAF integration  
- **Scalability & High Availability** – Auto Scaling, Load Balancing, and Route 53  
- **Database Integration** – Managed Amazon RDS deployment  
- **SSL & CDN Optimization** – Secure connections and content acceleration
